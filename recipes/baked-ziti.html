    <h2>Baked Ziti Recipe</h2>
    <p>Baked ziti is a classic Italian-American comfort dish featuring tender pasta, savory tomato sauce, and melted cheese.<br>The dish typically includes ziti pasta, which is combined with a rich marinara or meat sauce and layered with ricotta,<br>mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses. Once assembled, it is baked in the oven until the cheese becomes bubbly and<br>golden, creating a deliciously creamy and hearty casserole.</p>
    <p>Baked ziti is often seasoned with garlic, onions, and Italian herbs like basil and oregano, and may also include<br>ingredients such as ground beef, sausage, or vegetables for added flavor. It's a crowd-pleasing dish that's perfect<br>for family gatherings, potlucks, or any occasion where comfort food is a must.</p>
